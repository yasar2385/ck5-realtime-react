            This may be the first time you hear about this

            made-up<suggestion-end name="insertion:suggestion-1:user-2"></suggestion-end>
            disorder but it actually is not that far from the truth.
            As recent studies show, the language you speak has more effects on you than you realize.
            According to the studies, the language a person speaks affects their cognition,
            <suggestion-start name="deletion:suggestion-2:user-1"></suggestion-start>
            feelings, <suggestion-end name="deletion:suggestion-2:user-1"></suggestion-end>
            behavior, emotions and hence <strong>their personality</strong>.

            This shouldnâ€™t come as a surprise
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">since we already know</a>
            that different regions of the brain become more active depending on the activity.
            The structure, information and especially
            <suggestion-start name="attribute:bold|ci1tcnk0lkep:suggestion-3:user-1"></suggestion-start><strong>the
            culture of languages<suggestion-end name="attribute:bold|ci1tcnk0lkep:suggestion-3:user-1"></strong></suggestion-end>
            varies substantially
            and the language a person speaks is an essential element of daily life.
